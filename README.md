# The BitDevs Playbook v0.1.0

The BitDevs Playbook by [Btrust](https://www.btrust.tech/) is a comprehensive guide for organizers, sponsors, and partners involved in growing Bitcoin-only technical communities across the Global South, starting from Africa. It provides a clear framework for how to start, operate, and sustain BitDevs locations, while outlining the principles, expectations, and standards that ensure every location runs with the same quality, transparency, and impact.

It serves as:  
- A manual for organizers setting up or managing BitDevs locations.  
- A reference for sponsors and partners to understand processes, reporting, and accountability standards.  
- A resource for for participants and community members to align with the broader movement.   

As BitDevs locations grow, improve, and share new lessons, this playbook will evolve to reflect these insights and strengthen the ecosystem.

## How to Use This Playbook
The playbook is divided into sections that mirror the lifecycle of a BitDevs location, from setup to operations, quality control, and closure if necessary. Each section includes steps, templates, and references. While everyone should read the entire playbook to understand how BitDevs locations operate as a cohesive network, the sections below provide a streamlined way to get started based on your role: 

- **New Organizers:** Start with Section 2 (“Starting a BitDevs Location”) to learn how to set up a new location from scratch. Follow with Section 4 (“Quality Control”) for standards from day one. Then, read Section 6 (“Guide for Organizers”) for team and personal development guidance.
- **Active Locations:** Focus first on Section 3 (“Running a BitDevs Location”) for operational guidance. Revisit Section 4 (“Quality Control”) regularly. Refer to Section 6 (“Guide for Organizers”) to continue developing your team and skills.
- **Sponsors and Supporters:** Refer to Section 7 (“Guide for Sponsors”) for funding models, accountability, and collaboration expectations.   
- **Everyone:** Begin with Section 1 (“Introduction”) to understand BitDevs principles, identity, and ethos.
- **Annexes:** Contain templates, examples, and checklists referenced throughout the playbook for practical use.
