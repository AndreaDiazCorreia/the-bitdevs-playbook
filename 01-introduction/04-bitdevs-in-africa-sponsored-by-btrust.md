# BitDevs in Africa: Sponsored by Btrust

Btrust sponsors and supports BitDevs locations across Africa as part of its mission to decentralize Bitcoin development and strengthen the continent’s grassroots technical communities. Sponsorship includes funding, operational guidance, and inclusion in the regional organizer network.

Through this sponsorship, local developers, builders, and learners gain the resources, consistency, and structure needed to explore Bitcoin at a deep technical level, independently and in alignment with global standards.

To qualify for and maintain sponsorship, BitDevs locations must follow the principles and operational framework outlined in this playbook. This includes hosting regular Bitcoin-only technical meetups, sharing timely reports, and actively participating in cross-location collaboration and knowledge exchange.

## How We Communicate

All Btrust-supported BitDevs locations use a shared communication system to coordinate and learn from one another.

### BitDevs Organizers in Africa Discord Channel
Organizers have access to a dedicated channel within the Btrust Builders Discord server for coordination, updates, and shared learning.

### Monthly Organizers Check-In
Currently held on the last Tuesday of every month, this meeting gathers all location leads to:

- Share meetup highlights and key takeaways  
- Discuss challenges and solutions  
- Coordinate upcoming events, reports, or joint initiatives  
- Exchange ideas, resources, and best practices  

Each location must have at least one representative present to maintain active sponsorship status.
