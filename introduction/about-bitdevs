# About BitDevs

BitDevs is a global network of technical, Bitcoin-only meetups that bring together developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who care deeply about Bitcoin and are committed to contributing to its continued success. First pioneered in [NYC](https://bitdevs.org/), each location since runs autonomously but stays connected through a shared commitment to open dialogue, critical thinking, and advancing technical understanding of Bitcoin. 

Around the world, BitDevs locations create spaces to:
- Explore new developments in Bitcoin research, protocols, and open-source projects.
- Discuss and analyze proposed upgrades, design trade-offs, layer-2 solutions and implementation details.
- Learn from one another in an environment grounded in curiosity and collaboration.

In Africa, most BitDevs meetups are sponsored by [Btrust](https://www.btrust.tech/), a non-profit focused on decentralizing Bitcoin development and empowering developers across the Global South, and supported by [Btrust Builders](https://www.btrust.tech/builders). These meetups nurture local talent, strengthen technical confidence, and connect African communities to the wider global Bitcoin ecosystem.
