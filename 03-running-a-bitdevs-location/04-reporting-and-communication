# Reporting and Communication

Reporting is a key accountability and learning tool that helps locations grow sustainably and enables sponsors to provide continued support.

## Documentation Standards

Each location must maintain updated folders for:

- **Meetup Reports**: Summaries of each event, including date, agenda, key takeaways, and attendance.
- **Finance Reports**: Details of expenses, receipts, and remaining balances.
- **Media or Attachments**: Photos (if approved), slides, and any supplementary materials.

Reports should be submitted **monthly**, even if a meetup was postponed, with explanations where necessary.

## Internal Communication

- Keep your organizing team aligned through shared documents, group chats, and periodic reviews.
- Communicate upcoming plans and challenges early to avoid gaps in operations.
- For Btrust-sponsored locations:
  - Submit both **Meetup** and **Finance Reports** to your designated folder by the 10th of the following month.
  - Attend the scheduled monthly organizer check-in.  
  - Use the **BitDevs Organizers in Africa Discord** channel for quick questions, collaboration, or peer learning.

### External Communication

- Share concise, educational recaps on your website or social channels after each meetup.
- Keep communication Bitcoin-focused, non-commercial, and aligned with BitDevs’ technical ethos.
- Avoid branding that suggests affiliation with companies unless it is part of a transparent sponsorship acknowledgment.

Running a BitDevs location is an ongoing commitment to consistency, transparency, and technical excellence. Organizers who maintain clear planning routines, foster discussion-based learning, and actively engage their communities build lasting, self-sustaining ecosystems of developers and builders.
