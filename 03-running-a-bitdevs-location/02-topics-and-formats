# Choosing Topics and Formats

A BitDevs meetup is not a lecture or panel; it’s a collaborative technical discussion. Learning happens through dialogue and analysis, not one-way presentations.

## Choosing Topics

- Prioritize Bitcoin protocol updates, research papers, developer mailing lists, BIPs, and open-source project developments.
- Explore practical applications such as wallet design, Lightning development, or privacy tooling.
- Balance content between deep technical discussions for regular attendees and accessible topics to onboard new participants.
- Reference global BitDevs archives for inspiration (e.g., [NYC](https://bitdevs.org/), [London](https://londonbitdevs.org/), [Austin](https://austinbitdevs.com/)). See [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/) or [Bitcoin-OPS](https://bitcoinops.org/) for latest and historical Bitcoin technical topics.

## Structuring the Meetup

- Open with a short welcome and reminder of BitDevs principles: Bitcoin-only, technical focus, open dialogue, and privacy.
- Follow the [Socratic Seminar](https://bitdevs.org/running-a-great-socratic-seminar/) style: moderators introduce curated topics one by one, summarize briefly, and prompt discussion.
- Encourage contributions from attendees by asking open-ended questions and allowing debate and clarification.
- Keep each topic segment between **10–15 minutes**, depending on complexity.
- Close with community announcements, upcoming events, or project updates from local contributors. 

## Speakers and Presentations

- Guest presentations should be technical, educational, and aligned with open-source values. No product pitches or marketing.
- Limit each presentation to 10–15 minutes and reserve time for questions.
- For Btrust-sponsored locations, guest speakers should be pre-approved if they involve funded logistics.

## Privacy and Culture

- Apply [Chatham House Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): participants may share insights but not attribute quotes or identities.
- Avoid photography or recording unless explicitly approved by all attendees.
- Always foster an environment of respect, curiosity, and open exchange.
