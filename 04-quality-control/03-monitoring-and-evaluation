# Monitoring and Evaluation

To sustain excellence, BitDevs locations are encouraged to regularly assess their performance and document progress. Monitoring and evaluation are not about enforcement, but about learning, continuous improvement, and scaling what works across the network.

## Self-Monitoring Practices

Each location should take ownership of its quality by regularly reflecting on its activities and outcomes:

- **Quarterly Reviews**  
  Review meetups every quarter, focusing on attendance trends, participant feedback, and the overall quality of discussions.

- **Capacity Building**  
  Rotate facilitation and organizational duties among team members to build resilience, reduce burnout, and introduce fresh perspectives.

- **Content Alignment**  
  Periodically assess whether topics and discussions align with BitDevs’ technical goals and the evolving needs of the local community.

## Network-Level Monitoring (Btrust-Sponsored Locations)

Btrust applies a light but structured review process to maintain accountability and network-wide quality:

- **Monthly Reports**  
  Meetup and finance reports are reviewed to confirm ongoing activity, adherence to standards, and responsible use of funds.

- **Quarterly Reviews**  
  Locations receive aggregated feedback based on submitted reports, event summaries, and peer observations across the network.

- **Organizer Check-ins**  
  Regular organizer calls serve as peer-learning sessions where challenges, successes, and best practices are shared. Physical site visits by the Btrust team may also be conducted periodically.

- **Support and Capacity Building**  
  If a location experiences recurring challenges (such as low turnout or organizational gaps), the Btrust team may provide tailored support, mentorship, or co-hosting guidance.

This collaborative monitoring approach ensures that locations remain aligned with BitDevs values, improve continuously, and maintain visibility and credibility across the broader network.
